👀 I’m interested in data analytics, web3 technologies, and sustainable development projects.

🌱 I’m currently learning advanced Python programming, data visualization with Looker Studio, and blockchain concepts.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects related to data-driven decision-making, blockchain applications, and AI-driven solutions.
