Hi there! 👋 I’m Ceren , an Artificial Intelligence Junior Specialist with a strong background in Mathematics and Computer Science.

Currently, I’m working at OneNewOne (İTÜ ARI Teknokent), where I contribute to AI-driven product development and R&D projects. My focus is on creating scalable, data-powered solutions that transform recruitment and HR technologies.

I have hands-on experience in data analytics, machine learning, and product lifecycle management, gained through diverse roles and internships at Shell, Ford Otosan, Türkiye İş Bankası, and Mimar Sinan Fine Arts University. These experiences allowed me to build a strong foundation in both technical problem-solving and strategic decision-making.

🏆 Along the way, I’ve earned recognition in various innovation and AI competitions, including:

🥇 Lenovo AI Marathon – 1st Place (2025)

🥇 Anadolu Efes Product Development Competition – 1st Place (2025)

🥈 TEB “İcat Çıkar” Innovation Challenge – 2nd Place (2025)

🥈 Binance Web3 Ideathon – 2nd Place (2023)

Beyond the technical side, I’m deeply passionate about building sustainable and socially impactful AI solutions. I believe technology should not only drive business value but also create a positive impact on society and the environment.
